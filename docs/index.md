    `rosonic` is currently in pre-relase. That means there will be breaking
    changes as this package grows and becomes better.

## ROS made pythonic

Spend less time working on ROS, spend more time working on Robotics. `rosonic`
is a library that lets you write ROS code with ease and speed.

ROS is neither a very good or very bad software system. There are a few problems
with ROS and python as is outlined in [Motivation](motivation.md).
`rosonic` seeks to solve these by gently "forcing" you to follow a design
pattern. Namely, `rosonic` conceptualizes a ROS node as a class in a simple,
pythonic way with reasonable default behaviours. As a consequence `rosonic`
becomes great for both ROS beginners and experienced developers.
